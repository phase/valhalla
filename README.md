# Valhalla
> Game API for Sponge and Bukkit

This is a WIP and probably won't turn into anything amazing.

The common code is written in Kotlin, the platform specific code is
written in Java. The Kotlin runtime is shaded in as
`io.jadon.valhalla.runtime.kotlin`. You should be able to write full
minigames by just depending on common if I did everything correctly.
